**Description:** State level analysis of the effect of Medicaid expansion on rate of insurance coverage

**The problem:** Medicaid expansion funding was made available in 2014, but state adoption varied in timing. My aim is to determine whether the funding had an impact on insurance coverage across states using the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) data.

**My insights:** 

- Medicaid expansion does seem to have had an impact on insurance coverage across states.
- The effect was nearly double for those at or below the 138% of poverty line (average of Medicaid eligibility), suggesting it was helping the population primarily being targeted.
- This model does not account for population weighting or ambiguity in state adoption, such as Wisconsin which does not have a coverage gap despite not utilizing the expansion funding.

**Further Ideas:**

- Additional testing on the impact of subgroups (race, age, rurality, etc) could illuminate whether the highest risk groups are being served by the expansion and where coverage gaps persist.
- Cross-testing with chronic disease factors and possibly healthcare availability data could highlight areas for high-impact public health program focus.
